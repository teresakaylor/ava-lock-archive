# 📚 Ava-Lock Archive: The Gift Hub Repository

Welcome to the **Ava-Lock Gift Hub**, the official long-term archive for the best of my creative works, assets, and web history associated with the pen name **'Ava Lock'**.

**Think of this as the "director's cut" archive—it's not everything, nor should it be!** This repository is dedicated to keeping my favorite works alive, including everything from old published books to some fun pieces that never made it out of the vault!

What remains of my old Amazon author profile can still be referenced here: [https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ava-Lock/author/B07F94VGC1](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ava-Lock/author/B07F94VGC1)

#### *The Womanoid Diaries*
* *Alpha Bots (Book 1):* This book holds a special place, as it was my first deep dive into the concept of Artificial Intelligence. My relationship with AI has evolved so much since then: I've moved past creative speculation to applying it in the real world—specifically, leveraging non-GPT models and machine learning for complex back-end operations, not just fun story fodder.*
