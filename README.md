# 📚 Ava-Lock Archive: The Gift Hub Repository

Welcome to the **Ava-Lock Gift Hub**, the official long-term archive for the best of my creative works, assets, and web history associated with the pen name **'Ava Lock'**.

**Think of this as the "director's cut" archive—it's not everything, nor should it be!** This repository is dedicated to keeping my favorite works alive, including everything from old published books to some fun pieces that never made it out of the vault!

What remains of my old Amazon author profile can still be referenced here: [https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ava-Lock/author/B07F94VGC1](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ava-Lock/author/B07F94VGC1)

#### *The Womanoid Diaries*
* *Alpha Bots (Book 1):* This book holds a special place, as it was my first deep dive into the concept of Artificial Intelligence. My relationship with AI has evolved so much since then: I've moved past creative speculation to applying it in the real world—specifically, leveraging non-GPT models and machine learning for complex back-end operations, not just fun story fodder.*

#### *Space Hysteria:*
This standalone novel is a deeply personal piece. It's a love letter written to my father, not the schizophrenic lost-in-space man that he is today, but the huggable daddy he was when I was a little girl. But make no mistake, it's horror watching Bob go insane.

#### *Deadly Sins:*
This series marked a major milestone in my growth as a writer. However, halfway through, the series faced an unexpected hurdle: Amazon abruptly killed the release of **Book 5: *Lust***. To this day, the reason remains a mystery—no explanation, no remedy, and even Amazon staff couldn't clarify the issue. The entire pre-order page vanished, completely disrupting the middle of the series. The good news? It's now safe here in the archive. You can read it for free!
